        <p class="mt-5">This is a report made by PNS Solutions with the goal of providing a more efficient view
          towards the markets
          of Germany, Poland and Ukraine for new Ice Cream producers and sellers that are looking forward to expanding
          their business and
          would like to get details on promising countries. As those 3 have shown great potential, we have made a report
          to illustrate our
          data findings. You can go through the whole report or use the navigation bar to get straight to the point you
          want to check.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-5">Getting started</h3>

        <p>Here you get general information about these countries. All of them are located in Europe and they are close
          to each other. Poland and Germany are the members of European Union, what gives them opportunity to trade
          freely between themselves. The fact of having common border and market makes trade in this area more simple.
          Costs of transportation might be reduce if countries are used as transit states. For sure, non-obstacles
          creates lots of opportunities for reducing costs and misspending money. In that situation, that is easy to
          create supply chain or warehouse network.
          In case of Ukraine, it is a little bit different and difficult. Ukraine is not a member of European Union,
          though both of them have signed the Association Agreement and the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area
          (DCFTA). Ukraine is a priority partner within the Eastern Partnership and the European Neighbourhood Police
          (ENP). The Eu is seeking an increasingly close relationship with Ukraine, going beyond co-operation, to
          gradual economic integration and deepening of political co-operation. It gives you an access to new developing
          market, in which you can rapidly place your niche.</p>

            <p>As we see from graph, Germany has the highest expenditure per household on ice cream, also Germany and
              Poland has stable growth of it. Although, situation into Ukraine is not so good as in others. Market is
              unstable,we can see from table some fluctuation from 2012 till 2016.
              When looking at the expenditure exclusively we get the impression, that Germany is the most attractive
              country for a market entry, since people are willing to spend nearly three times more on ice cream than
              the other countries observed.
              We got a question why did Ukraine get these fluctuation in ice-cream market.What we found out is there was
              war between Ukraine and Russia, some of factories were localized in/by war area and they must have shut
              down the businesses because of threat or just occupation. As we are going to show later, in Ukraine was
              high inflation in the period, and it also has an influence.

            <p>Our team decided to take into consideration only tendency of market changing, except for the market size.
              It is obvious that higher economic development of country has a bigger market size. Researched the markets
              we found out that nowadays considered countries have rising of their domestic markets. But not always it
              was like that. For instance, in Ukraine was declining of ice-cream market from 2013 till 2015 which equals
              39%. It is explained by territorial conflict which led to shutting down of some factories. Now situation
              in Ukraine is not so good and there appears some reducing of growth, nevertheless it is a growth. Due to
              Passport there should be higher growth which will equal 7% what is awesome for Ukraine.
              In Germany we have as always stable growth which equals 1-2% what is good. It shows that market is stable
              and established. There will not appear unpredicted changes or âhugeâ competitors because they are already
              there and take the niche.
              Amazing tendency we observe in Poland. It has had rapid growth since 2016. Among overseen states higher
              growth was only in Ukraine in 2013 which equaled 36%. Polish market it is a marked which develops
              constantly. According to Passport database, Poland will stay wider in following years. Within two
              following years growth will be 14% what is an awesome number for developed state.

            <p>The topic of Inflation rate. We are sure that Inflation rate is the one of the most important thing when
              you are making market research. It shows threats and possible bonuses of market. From found information,
              we would like to point out that in the markets were totally different situations. In Germany has been
              typical for developed state situation. It has had slow growing inflation which not suppose to bring some
              disasters or unpleasant situation Situation in Poland has been a little bit different. It had even
              deflation in 2015,2016, but now the monetary market has been showing stable inflation from 2017 and there
              is prediction to be so. The most complex situation in Ukraine. It has a high inflation after 2013, but has
              good tendency of inflation reducing. In 2018 the rate of whole price changing was 11% what is harmful for
              Ukrainian economy, but useful for foreign investors. Even though, before crisis, in 2013 was deflation on
              level of 0,3%. High inflation makes Ukrainian market more attractive for FDI (Foreign Direct Investment).

            <p>(lack of data for Ukraine)
              Below you could see a table of statistic data of ice-cream production in millions of liter for Germany
              (blue line) and Poland (orange line). Unfortunately, we did not find such information for Ukraine.
              It is not a secret that Germany is the second biggest producer of the good among European Union members
              and concurrently the biggest exporter in the world. Although it has had unsatisfied tendency since 2014
              but now Deutschland has slow aresing and in accordance with Bizvibe it will have had growth in scale of
              11% by 2021.
              In case of Poland, everything looks different. Poland had got fast and high growth of production by 2016.
              In 2017 it began to decline and return to usual market condition which had been before 2015. It means good
              opportunity to take easily a place on market and stay on there.

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col text-dark">
            <p>Our team checked out how many people avoided consumption of dairy goods in Europe. Unfortunately, we were
              able to collect data only for 3 years, but we got it for different generation groups. We would like to
              point out that middle generation group which is in age from 45-59 years old had bad tendency (we
              highlighted it on graph through crossing line) for sellers. There is a unsatisfied tendency for sellers at
              all. During these 3 years, number of people who decided to give up consuming of dairy products ( which are
              partly ice-cream) increased 1.3%, from 10,7% in 2015 to 12% in 2017. Of course, it is not describing exact
              situation in pointed countries, but it helps to figure out what happens on whole european market. You may
              ask us why we did such type of research. Because it may helps to aim upon specific group of people for
              making marketing things or to flee a group which are not interested in the item.
