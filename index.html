        <p class="mt-5">This is a report made by PNS Solutions with the goal of providing a more efficient view
          towards the markets
          of Germany, Poland and Ukraine for new Ice Cream producers and sellers that are looking forward to expanding
          their business and
          would like to get details on promising countries. As those 3 have shown great potential, we have made a report
          to illustrate our
          data findings. You can go through the whole report or use the navigation bar to get straight to the point you
          want to check.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-5">Getting started</h3>

        <p>Here you get general information about these countries. All of them are located in Europe and they are close
          to each other. Poland and Germany are the members of European Union, what gives them opportunity to trade
          freely between themselves. The fact of having common border and market makes trade in this area more simple.
          Costs of transportation might be reduce if countries are used as transit states. For sure, non-obstacles
          creates lots of opportunities for reducing costs and misspending money. In that situation, that is easy to
          create supply chain or warehouse network.
          In case of Ukraine, it is a little bit different and difficult. Ukraine is not a member of European Union,
          though both of them have signed the Association Agreement and the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area
          (DCFTA). Ukraine is a priority partner within the Eastern Partnership and the European Neighbourhood Police
          (ENP). The Eu is seeking an increasingly close relationship with Ukraine, going beyond co-operation, to
          gradual economic integration and deepening of political co-operation. It gives you an access to new developing
          market, in which you can rapidly place your niche.</p>

          <div class="col-md-4 col">
            <p>The product we choose is called ice cream, which is a sweetened frozen food, typically eaten as
              a snack or dessert. It is unusually often in store made from milk and cream, and usually combined with
              fruits
              or other ingredients and flavors. It is normally sweetened with sugar.
              Typically, colors and flavours are added in order to appear more natural, healthy and tasty. The mixture
              is
              stirred to incorporate air spaces and cooled below the freezing point of water to prevent detectable ice
              crystals from forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is served at very low temperatures
              below 2

              The meaning of the name "ice cream" varies in the countries Germany, Poland and Ukraine, which we look at.
              In
              Germany it is simply called “Eis”, which can be translated to ice, without further descriptive add ons. In
              Ukraine people named the good “Морозиво”, which sounds like “ Morozyvo”. In Poland terms such as "frozen
              custard," "frozen yogurt," "sorbet," "gelato," and others are used to distinguish different varieties and
              styles in different countries and cultures. In the observed countries, governments regulate the commercial
              use
              of the various terms according to the relative quantities of the main ingredients, notably the amount of
              cream. Products that do not meet the criteria to be called ice cream are labelled “Tiefgefrohrenes
              Dessert”
              "frozen dessert", in Germany instead. In another country, such as Ukraine, one word has only one meaning,
              which is “frozen one” and has single meaning. Well, customer will not be confused what is inside of
              package.
              For those who are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy protein, or vegan there are ice creams made from
              dairy
              alternatives, such as goat's or sheep's milk, or milk substitutes in all of the three countries we
              researched.
              Ice cream can be served in dishes, for eating with a spoon, or licked from cones. Ice cream is often
              combined
              with other desserts, such as cake, pie, or as an ingredient in ice cream floats, sundaes, milkshakes, ice
              cream cakes and even baked dishes.

          <p>Germany has had a free and globalized market for decades and in the group of countries that we compare, the
            longest time. This is also visible in the exports, Germany is Europe's number one ice cream exporter and
            also in the company shares in the german market.
            There has been little to no movement between 2013 and 2018. The few changes are due to company takeovers and
            no entries.
            This would make germany the least interesting country to enter, but what we have to consider is the huge
            size of the market and the room for niches. Germany is the biggest and one of the richest markets in europe
            and due to that stays interesting for a market entry, even though the company shares of the biggest players
            have almost not changed at all in the past decade.

            <p>In Germany, there is a bigger diversity of packaging types than Poland and Ukraine.This is due to the
              longer existence of a free market and biggest competition. Because of a bigger amount of companies and
              brand diversity, it is also harder to stand out by making a different packaging. There is a great tendency
              for paper based containers and they become more appealing for customers because paper is more natural and
              people prefer it over plastic for saving the environment. We recommend using paper containers in a market
              entry because of this fact.</p>

          <p>In Poland the market of ice cream is very interesting because of both potential and growth. We can see a
            relatively big change in the company shares from 2013 to 2018. In 2013 the market was mainly controlled by
            small and private labeled companies, which had little international interference whatsoever. But due to a
            common european market and globalisation, their shares have fallen quickly. With the market entry of
            unilever group, partly by expansion of already owned companies and party by purchase of polish companies
            this very international and global company was able to become Poland's number one ice cream producer and
            seller.
            For the potential market entry in Poland these are very good signs. We are dealing with a fast growing -high
            potential market with room for expansions.
            This makes Poland our mostly recommended ice cream market to enter in.

            <p>The polish situation is similar to the Ukrainian. A large part of the market belongs to flexible
              packaging, but the difference is not as big. This can be explained by their shared communist past.
              We recommend a different packaging for a market entry in order to stick out and provide a unique customer
              experience. The market is stable and it is not expected to change in big numbers.

          <p>Looking at the ukrainian market shares and their development, it becomes obvious that this country is not
            part of a european customs union and far away from a free market. All main players are not only ukrainian,
            but also owned by the so called “oligarchs” wich are a remain of the failed entry of a free market in
            Ukraine after the fall of the soviet union.
            Even worse is the development. In opposition to everything we have been hearing from ukrainian government
            officials in the past decade, this country is far away from real competition. Almost all major ice cream
            sellers that were in place 2013 are there in 2018 as well.
            For the potential entry of this market these are very bad news. It is expected to be almost impossible to
            enter due to corruption and government intervention in the market.

            <p>As we see from graph, Germany has the highest expenditure per household on ice cream, also Germany and

              When looking at the expenditure exclusively we get the impression, that Germany is the most attractive
              country for a market entry, since people are willing to spend nearly three times more on ice cream than
              the other countries observed.
              We got a question why did Ukraine get these fluctuation in ice-cream market.What we found out is there was
              war between Ukraine and Russia, some of factories were localized in/by war area and they must have shut
              down the businesses because of threat or just occupation. As we are going to show later, in Ukraine was
              high inflation in the period, and it also has an influence.

            <p>Our team decided to take into consideration only tendency of market changing, except for the market size.
              It is obvious that higher economic development of country has a bigger market size. Researched the markets
              we found out that nowadays considered countries have rising of their domestic markets. But not always it
              was like that. For instance, in Ukraine was declining of ice-cream market from 2013 till 2015 which equals
              39%. It is explained by territorial conflict which led to shutting down of some factories. Now situation
              in Ukraine is not so good and there appears some reducing of growth, nevertheless it is a growth. Due to
              Passport there should be higher growth which will equal 7% what is awesome for Ukraine.
              In Germany we have as always stable growth which equals 1-2% what is good. It shows that market is stable
              and established. There will not appear unpredicted changes or “huge” competitors because they are already
              there and take the niche.
              Amazing tendency we observe in Poland. It has had rapid growth since 2016. Among overseen states higher
              growth was only in Ukraine in 2013 which equaled 36%. Polish market it is a marked which develops
              constantly. According to Passport database, Poland will stay wider in following years. Within two
              following years growth will be 14% what is an awesome number for developed state.

              you are making market research. It shows threats and possible bonuses of market. From found information,
              we would like to point out that in the markets were totally different situations. In Germany has been
              typical for developed state situation. It has had slow growing inflation which not suppose to bring some
              disasters or unpleasant situation Situation in Poland has been a little bit different. It had even
              deflation in 2015,2016, but now the monetary market has been showing stable inflation from 2017 and there
              is prediction to be so. The most complex situation in Ukraine. It has a high inflation after 2013, but has
              good tendency of inflation reducing. In 2018 the rate of whole price changing was 11% what is harmful for
              Ukrainian economy, but useful for foreign investors. Even though, before crisis, in 2013 was deflation on
              level of 0,3%. High inflation makes Ukrainian market more attractive for FDI (Foreign Direct Investment).

              It is not a secret that Germany is the second biggest producer of the good among European Union members
              and concurrently the biggest exporter in the world. Although it has had unsatisfied tendency since 2014
              but now Deutschland has slow aresing and in accordance with Bizvibe it will have had growth in scale of

              In case of Poland, everything looks different. Poland had got fast and high growth of production by 2016.
              In 2017 it began to decline and return to usual market condition which had been before 2015. It means good

          <p>After spending hours, days and months investigating the insights of three very interesting and
            simultaneously complicated economies we can finally conclude our both surprising and at the same time very
            reasonable results.
            We learned that Germany, Poland and Ukraine are as full of history and opportunity as they are different to
            each other. With Germany being a long established and well accessible market that has the biggest group of
            customers not only in our comparison, but also in the whole of Europe, it offers a lot of possibilities.
            Throughout the carefully observed time frame, the inflation rate in Germany has been steadily well.
            Additionally the citizen of this breathtaking country earn well and consume a lot. This plays into
            everyone's hand that enters the german market and also counts positively for a potential entry into the ice
            cream market. Unfortunately this is also where germany's greatest weakness lays. In this economy we can find
            a lot and while comparing these three countries -the most competition. The two biggest players in the frozen
            desert market, Unilever and Nestle both aggressively attack this market by expanding current and buying
            additional company shares. Also Germany is the greatest producer of ice cream in europe and its citizens are
            happy to consume domestically to a low expenditure. This drives down the price and increases competition,
            which is not optimal for a possible market entry. The only logic option is the entry into a niche, but since
            this is not the main target Germany fortunately disqualifies for our number one country.
            This brings us to the next country compared: Ukraine. After concluding about the best developed economy, we
            now look at its equal counterpart, the worst developed one. In Ukraine unemployment is high, corruption
            great and a war in place which threatens to overthrow the entire socioeconomic system. But of course this is
            only half of the truth.
            The people's republic of Ukraine has good tendency of economic development what makes its market more
            attractive. Citizens become to earn more, as a result they could spend more. Ukraine has lower tariff rate
            than other compared states and it makes easier to penetrate the market because it will not change a price on
            ice-cream a lot. Possibly Ukraine might become a member of European Union what may help to do business
            there. The market and country as whole had been unstable for years, but, fortunately, it becomes better and
            better. Nowadays it grows stably and without any unpredicted situations .Due to such unfavorable case which
            occurred in the state, lots of producers went away or were shut down. It helped new companies entered the
            market but also existed firms to stay bigger. Such three companies as Zhytomyrsky Maslozavod, Lasunka and
            Lvivsky Kholodokombinat became the owners of almost 70% of market shares.
            Ukraine has an access to sea and it makes trade simpler and cheaper, on account of low costs of ship
            delivery.Geographical location is important if you want to operate in the market and even further to open a
            factory there. Ukraine is localized almost in middle of Europe and it makes a distribution of the good
            easier and cheaper in any directions.
            After comparing Germany and Ukraine and concluding that both of these interesting and different countries
            both do not account for our number one choice, our favorite is now obvious. It's the perfect mixture of
            established authorities, a reliable legal system and also great growth and a lot of opportunity: Poland.
            Poland offers everything for a market entry that Germany and Ukraine lack off. Nestle and Unilever have not
            been around for too long and still a lot of the market shares are owned by relatively small companies that
            are not operating internationally, making it easier for a new entering company to compete with. Also Poland
            is, among the investigated economies the fastest growing one. The polish currency, the zloty has had a
            relatively reliable development in the past and a dangerously high inflation rate, like in Ukraine for
            example is not a problem. Polish people, since their entry to the European Union have learned and learned to
            enjoy consumption and are open minded about new products, due to their good experience with foreign brands
            in the past.
            Also Poland is a very young country, polish people on average have much more children than germans, which
            increases attraction, because young people make up the biggest customer group of frozen dessert products.
            Unlike in Germany, poles are not too fixed on their own brands and are also not big exporters of ice cream,
            so there is not too high of a competition to be expected with local producers.
            Of course, also in poland there is not honey running through rivers and other foreign competitors have seen
            the great opportunity of this market already. The big players in the branch are heavily growing and reaching
            to this market, but this doesn't mean that there is not room for further companies to expand to Poland.
            All in all, we conclude that all three countries offer unique opportunities in their own way. Germany
            because of its purchasing power, Ukraine due to its underdevelopment and a lack of foreign competitors. But
            considering every single aspect of our detailed research we conclude that Poland, because of its perfect
            mixture of the greatest opportunities of all observed countries is our number one recommendation to enter.
            Of course this heavily depends on your personal preferences as a company but from our side Poland gives the
            best and offers the most.

            Cream business markets of Germany, Poland and Ukraine.
